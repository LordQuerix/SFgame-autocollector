# 📝 Short description of the script
Script made for a friend, it's code is a total crap, I did it quickly and as long as it works, so the script clicks in places (maximum 3 places) designated by the person running the script

# 🤖 Requirements
you don't need to download, the script should install the necessary components itself

# ❓ How to install
Just download 'main.py' and 'run.bat' and open 'run.bat' | On first launch script will make a file, do not remove it, otherwise the script will install the necessary components again
